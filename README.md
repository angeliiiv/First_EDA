Exploritory Data Analysis of fitness data.

I wanted to get more practice with EDA and I figured fitness data would be a good place to start. 
I learned more about working with Pandas, Creating a custom, and messing with visualizations. I know I have more to learn but it was nice to mess around in the data.
